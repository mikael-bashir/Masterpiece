A project started on 1st of July, and estimated to take a month - a very complex css, anime style cinemagraph.

*edit 1:
The project was placed on hold for a few months, and is resumed - a more realistic timeline for the project is before 2025.
To view the current progress, open the project repository with a codespace, install live server from the menu on the left of vscode, view the moonSakura.html file with live server, and if prompted, select moonSakura.html again.
